As a User on Konnectore, you are enabled to build a large fan-base without limits, thereby showcasing yourself to the whole world at no costs. From time to time, The Stage (an integral platform on Konnectore) hosts a series of competition which allows Konnectore Users to solicit for votes from their friends, families, fans and members of the public in general. These votes enable Users with the most votes qualify for the finals, and the User with the highest votes automatically becomes the winner of the said competition.</p>
  <p>These competitions are conducted periodically, thus enabling a new winner every time. Votes may be cast by using money you deposited in your Konnectore e-wallet account on our website, USSD or through other payment options provided through our website. A single vote costs N50, but there is no limit to the number of votes that could be cast by you if you are voting. Votes, once cast cannot be refunded.

Konnectore allows you to make certain information private, or to make all of your information public. However, even if you adjust your privacy settings to make everything private, some information is public, no matter what you do. All public information can be seen by anyone, even if they do not have a Konnectore account. And “anyone” includes other websites, games, and various Web applications.
Choosing to make your information public also means that this information:
-can be associated with you (i.e., your name, profile pictures, cover photos, timeline, User ID, username, etc.) even off Konnectore;
-can show up when someone does a search on Konnectore or on a public search engine;
-will be accessible to the Konnectore-integrated games, applications, and websites you and your fans use; and
-will be accessible to anyone who uses our APIs.
Your private data: Konnectore allows you to make most of the information you share private. What “private” means is however up to you. You can either share with all your fans or use the “customize” sharing option accessible on each status update box, which lets you share the status update or photo with certain people, but not others. However, ALL your uploads can be accessed by anyone and everyone. ALL UPLOADS are deemed public and not private.
